# Multithreaded Clientâ€‘Server MST Solver (C++)

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This project provides a multithreaded **clientâ€“server** platform written in C++ that lets multiple clients build weighted, undirected graphs over a TCP socket and request **Minimumâ€‘Spanning Tree (MST)** solutions computed with **Prim** or **Kruskal** algorithms.  The server employs a **Pipelineâ€¯Activeâ€¯Object** pattern to process MST requests concurrently, streaming metrics such as total weight and path statistics back to each client without blocking new connections.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Clientâ€“Server over TCP** â€“ Supports multiple simultaneous clients, each with an independent inâ€‘memory graph.
- **Multithreading** â€“ Worker threads handle request parsing, MST computation, and response formatting in parallel.
- **Design Patterns** â€“ Uses Pipelineâ€¯Activeâ€¯Object for staged processing and modular extensibility.
- **Algorithms** â€“ Includes clean, headerâ€‘only implementations of **Prim** and **Kruskal** backed by an efficient **Unionâ€‘Find** structure.
- **Graph Analytics** â€“ Calculates total weight, longest path, average path length, and allâ€‘pairs shortest paths of the MST via a lightweight `Tree` utility.
- **Robust Testing & Profiling** â€“ Doctest unit tests plus Valgrind & Cachegrind scripts ensure correctness and performance.
